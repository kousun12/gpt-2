Thy fingers make early flowers of 

all things. 

thy hair mostly the hours love: 

a smoothness which 

sings, saying 

(though love be a day) 

do not fear, we will go amaying. 

thy whitest feet crisply are straying. 

Always 

thy moist eyes are at kisses playing, 

whose strangeness much 

says; singing 

(though love be a day) 

for which girl art thou flowers bringing? 

To be thy lips is a sweet thing 

and small. 

Death, Thee i call rich beyond wishing 

if this thou catch, 

else missing. 

(though love be a day 

and life be nothing, it shall not stop kissing).

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the merry deer ran before. 

Fleeter be they than dappled dreams 
the swift sweet deer 
the red rare deer. 

Four red roebuck at a white water 
the cruel bugle sang before. 

Horn at hip went my love riding 
riding the echo down 
..into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the level meadows ran before. 

Softer be they than slippered sleep 
the lean lithe deer 
the fleet flown deer. 

Four fleet does at a gold valley 
the famished arrow sang before. 

Bow at belt went my love riding 
riding the mountain down 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
the sheer peaks ran before. 



Paler be they than daunting death 
the sleek slim deer 
the tall tense deer. 

Four tall stags at a green mountain 
the lucky hunter sang before. 

All in green went my love riding 
on a great horse of gold 
into the silver dawn. 

four lean hounds crouched low and smiling 
my heart fell dead before.

when god lets my body be 

From each brave eye shall sprout a tree 
fruit that dangles therefrom 

the purpled world will dance upon 
Between my lips which did sing 

a rose shall beget the spring 

that maidens whom passion wastes 

will lay between their little breasts 
My strong fingers beneath the snow 

Into strenuous birds shall go 
my love walking in the grass 

, their wings will touch with her face 
and all the while shall my heart be 

With the bulge and nuzzle of the sea

the Cambridge ladies who live in furnished souls

daughters, unscented shapeless spirited) 

they believe in Christ and Longfellow, both dead,

delighted fingers knitting for the is it Poles?

it may not always be so; and i say 

that if your lips, which i have loved, should touch 

another's, and your dear strong fingers clutch 

his heart, as mine in time not far away; 

if on another's face your sweet hair lay 

in such a silence as i know, or such 

great writhing words as, uttering overmuch, 

stand helplessly before the spirit at bay; 

if this should be, i say if this should be 
you of my heart, send me a little word; 
that i may go unto him, and take his hands, 
saying, Accept all happiness from me. 
Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird 
sing terribly afar in the lost lands.

suppose 

Life is an old man carrying flowers on his head. 

young death sits in a caf============smiling, a piece of money held between 

his thumb and first finger

life totters, life has a beard" i 

say to you who are silent. "Do you see

likes flowers.

Spring is like a perhaps hand

a window,into which people look (while

spring is like a perhaps

why then 

we'd go up higher with all the pretty people 

than houses and steeples and clouds: 
go sailing 

away and away sailing into a keen 
city which nobody's ever visited, where 

always 

it's 

Spring) and everyone's 
in love and flowers pick themselves

i like my body when it is with your 

body. It is so quite new a thing. 

Muscles better and nerves more. 

i like your body, i like what it does, 

i like its hows, i like to feel the spine 

of your body and its bones, and the trembling 

-firm-smooth ness and which i will 

again and again and again 

kiss, i like kissing this and that of you, 

i like, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz 

of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes 

over parting flesh .... And eyes big love-crumbs, 

and possibly i like the thrill 
of under me you so quite new

little silent Christmas tree

you are more like a flower 

who found you in the green forest

i will kiss your cool bark 
and hug you safe and tight 
just as your mother would, 
only don't be afraid 

look the spangles 

that sleep all the year in a dark box 

dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine, 

the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads, 

put up your little arms 

and i'll give them all to you to hold 

every finger shall have its ring 

and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy 

then when you're quite dressed 

you'll stand in the window for everyone to see 

and how they'll stare! 

oh but you'll be very proud 

and my little sister and i will take hands 
and looking up at our beautiful tree 
we'll dance and sing

when you're hard up you pawn your 
intelligence to buy a drink and when 
you're flush pride keeps 

you from the pawn shop and 
because you are continually committing 
nuisances but more 
especially in your own house 

Humanity i love you because you 
are perpetually putting the secret of 
life in your pants and forgetting 
it's there and sitting down 

on it

forever making poems in the lap

i mean that the blond absence of any program

not for philosophy does this rose give a damn . . . 

bring on your fireworks, which are a mixed

your eyes (frailer than most deep dreams are frail) 

songs less firm than your body's whitest song

the glance too shy if through my singing slips 

the very skillful strangeness of your smile 

the keen primeval silence of your hair 

let the world say "his most wise music stole 
nothing from death" 

you only will create

lady through whose profound and fragile lips 
the sweet small clumsy feet of April came

i sing of Olaf glad and big 

whose warmest heart recoiled at war: 

a conscientious object-or 

his wellbeloved colonel (trig 
westpointer most succinctly bred) 
took erring Olaf soon in hand; 
but though an host of overjoyed 
noncoms( first knocking on the head 
him) do through icy waters roll 
that helplessness which others stroke 
with brushes recently employed 
anent this muddy toiletbowl, 
while kindred intellects evoke 
allegiance per blunt instruments 
Olaf (being to all intents 
a corpse and wanting any rag 
upon what God unto him gave) 
responds,without getting annoyed 
"I will not kiss your f.ing flag" 

straightway the silver bird looked grave 
(departing hurriedly to shave) 

but though all kinds of officers 
(a yearning nation's blueeyed pride) 
their passive prey did kick and curse 
until for wear their clarion 
voices and boots were much the worse, 
and egged the firstclassprivates on 
his rectum wickedly to tease 
by means of skilfully applied 
bayonets roasted hot with heat 
Olaf (upon what were once knees) 
does almost ceaselessly repeat 
"there is some s. I will not eat" 



============

our president,being of which 
assertions duly notified 
threw the yellowsonofabitch 
into a dungeon,where he died 

Christ (of His mercy infinite)

unless statistics lie he was 
more brave than me: more blond than you.

if there are any heavens my mother will (all by herself )hav<

============

a clown's smirk in the skull of a baboon 

(where once good lips stalked or eyes firmly stirred) 

my mirror gives me,on this afternoon; 

i am a shape that can but eat and turd 

ere with the dirt death shall him vastly gird, 

a coward waiting clumsily to cease 

whom every perfect thing meanwhile doth miss; 

a hand's impression in an empty glove, 

a soon forgotten tune,a house for lease. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

behold this fool who,in the month of June, 

having of certain stars and planets heard, 

rose very slowly in a tight balloon 

until the smallening world became absurd; 

him did an archer spy (whose aim had erred 

never) and by that little trick or this 

he shot the aeronaut down,into the abyss 

and wonderfully i fell through the green groove 

of twilight,striking into many a piece. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love 

god's terrible face,brighter than a spoon, 

collects the image of one fatal word; 

so that my life (which liked the sun and the moon) 

resembles something that has not occurred: 

i am a birdcage without any bird, 

a collar looking for a dog,a kiss 

without lips;a prayer lacking any knees 

but something beats within my shirt to prove 

he is undead who,living,noone is. 

I have never loved you dear as now i love. 



Hell (by most humble me which shall increase) 
open thy fire! for i have had some bliss 
of one small lady upon earth above; 
to whom i cry,remembering her face, 
i have never loved you dear as now i love 



============

if i love You 

(thickness means 

worlds inhabited by roamingly 

stern bright faeries 

if you love 

me) distance is mind carefully 
luminous with innumerable gnomes 
Of complete dream 

if we love each (shyly) 
other, what clouds do or Silently 
Flowers resembles beauty 
less than our breathing 



============

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond 
any experience,your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 

your slightest look easily will unclose me 

though i have closed myself as fingers, 

you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 

(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose 

or if your wish be to close me,i and 
my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 

Clothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture 
compels me with the colour of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 

(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens;only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody ,not even the rain,has such small hands 



============

but if a living dance upon dead minds 
why,it is love;but at the earliest spear 
of sun perfectly should disappear 
moon's utmost magic,or stones speak or one 
name control more incredible splendor than 
our merely universe,love's also there: 
and being here imprisoned,tortured here 
love everywhere exploding maims and blinds 
(but surely does not forget,perish,sleep 
cannot be photographed,measured;disdains

for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave

that noone loved him more by more

anyone's any was all to her

laughed their cryings and did their dance 
(sleep wake hope and then) they 
said their nevers they slept their dream 

stars rain sun moon 

(and only the snow can begin to explain 
how children are apt to forget to remember 
with up so floating many bells down) 

one day anyone died i guess 
(and noone stooped to kiss his face) 
busy folk buried them side by side 
little by little and was by was

my father moved through dooms of love 
through sames of am through haves of give, 
singing each morning out of each night 
my father moved through depths of height 

this motionless forgetful where 
turned at his glance to shining here; 
that if (so timid air is firm) 
under his eyes would stir and squirm 

newly as from unburied which 
floats the first who,his april touch 
drove sleeping selves to swarm their fates 
woke dreamers to their ghostly roots 

and should some why completely weep 
my father's fingers brought her sleep: 
vainly no smallest voice might cry 
for he could feel the mountains grow. 

Lifting the valleys of the sea 
my father moved through griefs of joy; 
praising a forehead called the moon 
singing desire into begin 

joy was his song and joy so pure 
a heart of star by him could steer 
and pure so now and now so yes 
the wrists of twilight would rejoice 

keen as midsummer's keen beyond 
conceiving mind of sun will stand, 
so strictly (over utmost him 
so hugely) stood my father's dream 



his flesh was flesh his blood was blood: 
no hungry man but wished him food; 
no cripple wouldn't creep one mile 
uphill to only see him smile. 

Scorning the pomp of must and shall 
my father moved through dooms of feel; 
his anger was as right as rain 
his pity was as green as grain 

septembering arms of year extend 
less humbly wealth to foe and friend 
than he to foolish and to wise 
offered immeasurable is 

proudly and (by octobering flame 
beckoned) as earth will downward climb, 
so naked for immortal work 
his shoulders marched against the dark 

his sorrow was as true as bread: 

no liar looked him in the head; 

if every friend became his foe 

he'd laugh and build a world with snow. 

My father moved through theys of we, 
singing each new leaf out of each tree 
(and every child was sure that spring 
danced when she heard my father sing) 

then let men kill which cannot share, 
let blood and flesh be mud and mire, 
scheming imagine,passion willed, 
freedom a drug that's bought and sold 



giving to steal and cruel kind, 
a heart to fear,to doubt a mind, 
to differ a disease of same, 
conform the pinnacle of am 

though dull were all we taste as bright, 
bitter all utterly things sweet, 
maggoty minus and dumb death 
all we inherit,all bequeath 

and nothing quite so least as truth 

i say though hate were why men breathe- 

because my father lived his soul 

love is the whole and more than all

one queerying wave will whitely yearn . 
from each last shore and home come young 

so truly perfectly the skies

love is more thicker than forget 
more thinner than recall 
more seldom than a wave is wet 
more frequent than to fail 

it is most mad and moonly 
and less it shall unbe 
than all the sea which only 
is deeper than the sea 

love is less always than to win 
less never than alive 
less bigger than the least begin 
less littler than forgive 

it is most sane and sunly 
and more it cannot die 
than all the sky which only 
is higher than the sky

hate blows a bubble of despair into 
hugeness world system universe and bang 
fear buries a tomorrow under woe 
and up comes yesterday most green and young 

pleasure and pain are merely surfaces 
(one itself showing,itself hiding one) 
life's only and true value neither is 
love makes the little thickness of the coin 

comes here a man would have from madame death 
neverless now and without winter spring? 
she'll spin that spirit her own fingers with 
and give him nothing (if he should not sing) 

how much more than enough for both of us 
darling. And if i sing you are my voice, 



============

what freedom's not some under's mere above 
but breathing yes which fear will never no? 
measureless our pure living complete love 
whose doom is beauty and its fate to grow 

shall hate confound the wise? doubt blind the brave? 
does mask wear face? have singings gone to say? 
here youngest selves yet younger selves conceive 
here's music's music and the day of day 

are worlds collapsing? any was a glove 
but i'm and you are actual either hand 
is when for sale? forever is to give 
and on forever's very now we stand 

nor a first rose explodes but shall increase

which something as you'll never guess

still doth our hero contemplate

gives the truth to summer's lie; 
bloodies with dizzying leaves the sun 
and yanks immortal stars awry? 
Blow king to beggar and queen to seem 
(blow friend to fiend: blow space to time) 
when skies are hanged and oceans drowned, 
the single secret will still be man 

what if a keen of a lean wind flays 
screaming hills with sleet and snow: 
strangles valleys by ropes of thing 
and stifles forests in white ago? 
Blow hope to terror;blow seeing to blind 
(blow pity to envy and soul to mind) 
whose hearts are mountains, roots are trees, 
it's they shall cry hello to the spring 

what if a dawn of a doom of a dream 
bites this universe in two, 
peels forever out of his grave 
and sprinkles nowhere with me and you? 
Blow soon to never and never to twice 
(blow life to isn't: blow death to was) 
all nothing's only our hugest home; 
the most who die,the more we live 



============

no man,if men are gods;but if gods must 
be men,the sometimes only man is this 
(most common, for each anguish is his grief; 
and,for his joy is more than joy,most rare) 

a fiend,if fiends speak truth ;if angels burn 

by their own generous completely light, 
an angel;or(as various worlds he'll spurn 
rather than fail immeasurable fate) 
coward,clown,traitor,idiot,dreamer,beast 

such was a poet and shall be and is 

who'll solve the depths of horror to defend 
a sunbeam's architecture with his life: 
and carve immortal jungles of despair 
to hold a mountain's heartbeat in his hand 



============

when god decided to invent 
everything he took one 
breath bigger than a circustent 
and everything began 

-when man determined to destroy 
himself he picked the was 
of shall and finding only why 
smashed it into because 



============

rain or hail 

sam done 

the best he kin 

till they digged his hole 

:sam was a man 

stout as a bridge 
rugged as a bear 
slickern a weazel 
how be you 

(sun or snow) 

gone into what 
like all them kings 
you read about 
and on him sings 

a whippoorwill; 

heart was big 
as the world aint square 
with room for the devil 
and his angels too 

yes,sir 

what may be better 
or what may be worse 
and what may be clover 
clover clover 

(nobody'll know) 

============

sam was a man 
grinned his grin 
done his chores 
laid him down. 

Sleep well 



============

let it go the 
smashed word broken 
open vow or 
the oath cracked length 
wise let it go it 
was sworn to 

g 

let them go the 

truthful liars and 

the false fair friends 

and the boths and 

neithers you must let them go they 

were born 

to go 

let all go the 
big small middling 
tafi bigger really 
the biggest and all 
things let all go 
dear 

so comes love 



9 ============

nothing false and possible is love 
(who's imagined,therefore limitless) 
love's to giving as to keeping's give; 
as yes is to if , love is to yes 

must's a schoolroom in the month of may: 
life's the deathboard where all now turns when 
(love's a universe beyond obey 
or command,reality or un-) 

proudly depths above why's first because 
(faith's last doubt and humbly heights below) 
kneeling, we true lovers pray that us 
will ourselves continue to outgrow 

all whose mosts if you have known and i've 
only we our least begin to guess 



============

except in your 

honour, 

my loveliest, 

nothing 

may move may rest 

you bring 

(out of dark the 
earth) a 
procession of 
wonders 

huger than prove 
our fears 

were hopes: the moon 

open 

for you and close 

will shy 

wings of because; 

each why 

of star (afloat 

on not 

quite less than all 

of time) 

gives you skilful 

his flame 

so is your heart 

alert, 

of languages 

there's none 

but well she knows; 

and can 



perfectly speak 

(snowflake 

and rainbow mind 

and soul 

november and 

april) 

who younger than 

begin 

are,the worlds move 

in your 

(and rest,my love) 

honour 



============

true lovers in each happening of their hearts 
live longer than all which and every who; 
despite what fear denies,what hope asserts, 
what falsest both disprove by proving true 

(all doubts,all certainties, as villains strive 
and heroes through the mere mind's poor pretend 
grim comics of duration: only love 
immortally occurs beyond the mind) 

such a forever is love's any now 

and her each here is such an everywhere, 

even more true would truest lovers grow 

if out of midnight dropped more suns than are 

(yes;and if time should ask into his was 
all shall,their eyes would never miss a yes) 



IOO 



S============

yes is a pleasant country: 

if s wintry 

(my lovely) 

let's open the year 

both is the very weather 

(not either) 

my treasure, 

when violets appear 

love is a deeper season 

than reason; 

my sweet one 

(and april's where we're) 



IOI 



============

all ignorance toboggans into know 
and trudges up to ignorance again: 
but winter's not forever,even snow 
melts;and if spring should spoil the game,what then? 

all history's a winter sport or three: 
but were it five,i'd still insist that all 
history is too small for even me; 
for me and you,exceedingly too small. 

Swoop(shrill collective myth)into thy grave 
merely to toil the scale to shrillerness 
per every madge and mabel dick and dave 
tomorrow is our permanent address 

and there they'll scarcely find us (if they do, 
we'll move away still further: into now 



============

darling! because my blood can sing 

and dance (and does with each your least 

your any most very amazing now 

or here) let pitiless fear play host 

to every isn't that's under the spring 

but if a look should april me, 

down isn't's own isn't go ghostly they 

doubting can turn men's see to stare 

their faith to how their joy to why 

their stride and breathing to limp and prove 

but if a look should april me, 

some thousand million hundred more 

bright worlds than merely by doubting have 

darkly themselves unmade makes love 

armies (than hate itself and no 
meanness unsmaller) armies can 
immensely meet for centuries 
and (except nothing) nothing's won 
but if a look should april me 
for half a when, whatever is less 
alive than never begins to yes 

but if a look should april me 

(though such as perfect hope can feel 

only despair completely strikes 

forests of mind,mountains of soul) 

quite at the hugest which of his who 

death is killed dead. Hills jump with brooks: 

trees tumble out of twigs and sticks; 



I0 ============

"sweet spring is your 

time is my time is our 

time for springtime is lovetime 

and viva sweet love" 

(all the merry little birds are 
flying in the floating in the 
very spirits singing in 
are winging in the blossoming) 

lovers go and lovers come 
awandering awondering 
but any two are perfectly 
alone there's nobody else alive 

(such a sky and such a sun 
i never knew and neither did you 
and everybody never breathed 
quite so many kinds of yes) 

not a tree can count his leaves 
each herself by opening 
but shining who by thousands mean 
only one amazing thing 

(secretly adoring shyly 
tiny winging darting floating 
merry in the blossoming 
always joyful selves are singing) 

"sweet spring is your 

time is my time is our 

time for springtime is lovetime 

and viva sweet love" 



============

o by the by 

has anybody seen 

little you-i 

who stood on a green 

hill and threw 

his wish at blue 

with a swoop and a dart 

out flew his wish 

(it dived like a fish 

but it climbed like a dream) 

throbbing like a heart 

singing like a flame 

blue took it my 
far beyond far 
and high beyond high 
bluer took it your 
but bluest took it our 
away beyond where 

what a wonderful thing 
is the end of a string 
(murmurs little you-i 
as the hill becomes nil) 
and will somebody tell 
me why people let go 



============


if everything happens chat can't be done 

(and anything's lighter 

than books 

could plan) 

the stupidest teacher will almost guess 

(with a run 

skip 

around we go yes) 

there's nothing as something as one 



one hasn't a why or because or although 

(and buds know better 

than books 

don't grow) 

one's anything old being everything new 

(with a what 

which 

around we come who) 

one's everyanything so 



so world is a leaf so tree is a bough 

(and birds sing sweeter 

than books 

tell how) 

so. here is away and so your is a my 

(with a down 

up 

around again fly) 

forever was never till now 



============

now i love you and you love me 

(and books are shuter 

than books 

can be) 

and deep in the high that does nothing but fal 

(with a shout 

each 

around we go all) 

there's somebody calling who's we 



we're anything brighter than even the sun 

(we're everything greater 

than books 

might mean) 

we're everyanything more than believe 

(with a spin 

leap 

alive we're alive) 

we're wonderful one times one 



============

when serpents bargain for the right to squirm 
and the sun strikes to gain a living wage- 
when thorns regard their roses with alarm 
and rainbows are insured against old age 

when every thrush may sing no new moon in 
if all screech-owls have not okayed his voice 
and any wave signs on the dotted line 
or else an ocean is compelled to close 

when the oak begs permission of the birch 
to make an acornvalleys accuse their 
mountains of having altitude and march 
denounces april as a saboteur 

then we'll believe in that incredible 
unanimal mankind (and not until) 



============

if a cheerfulest Elephantangelchild should sit 

(holding a red candle over his head 

by a finger of trunk,and singing out of a red 

book) on a proud round cloud in a white high night 

where his heartlike ears have flown adorable him 
self tail and all (and his tail's red Christmas bow) 
and if, when we meet againjittle he (having flown 
even higher) is sunning his penguinsoul in the glow 

of a joy which wasn't and isn't and won't be words 

while possibly not(at a guess)quite half way down 
to the earth are leapandswooping tinily birds 
whose magical gaiety makes your beautiful name 

i feel that(false and true are merely to know) 
Love only has ever been,is,and will ever be,So 



============

o to be in finland 
now that russia's here) 

swing low 
sweet ca 

rr 
yon 

(pass the freedoms pappy or 
uncle shylock not interested 





============

no time ago 
or else a life 
walking in the dark 
i met christ 

jesus) my heart 
flopped over 
and lay still 
while he passed (as 

close as i'm to you 
yes closer 
made of nothing 
except loneliness 



============

to start,to hesitate;to stop 
(kneeling in doubt: while all 
skies fall) and then to slowly trust 
T upon H,and smile 

could anything be pleasanter 
(some big dark little day 
which seems a lifetime at the least) 
except to add an A? 

henceforth he feels his pride involved 
(this i who's also you) 
and nothing less than excellent 
E will exactly do 

next (our great problem nearly solved) 
we dare adorn the whole 
with a distinct grandiloquent 
deep D;while all skies fall 

at last perfection,now and here 
but look: not sunlight? yes! 
and (plunging rapturously up) 
we spill our masterpiece 



============

if (touched by love's own secret) wejike homing 
through welcoming sweet miracles of air 
(and joyfully all truths of wing resuming) 
selves,into infinite tomorrow steer 

souls under whom flow (mountain valley forest) 
a million wheres which never may become 
one (wholly strange;familiar wholly) dearest 
more than reality of more than dream- 
how should contented fools of fact envision 
the mystery of freedom?yet,among 
their loud exactitudes of imprecision, 
you'li(siiently alighting) and i'll sing 

while at us very deafly a most stares 
colossal hoax of clocks and calendars 



============

i thank You God for most this amazing 
day: for the leaping greenly spirits of trees 
and a blue true dream of sky;and for everything 
which is natural which is infinite which is yes 

(i who have died am alive again today, 
and this is the sun's birthday ;this is the birth 
day of life and of love and wings: and of the gay 
great happening illimitably earth) 

how should tasting touching hearing seeing 
breathing any lifted from the no 
of all nothinghuman merely being 
doubt unimaginable You? 

(now the ears of my ears awake and 
now the eyes of my eyes are opened) 



============

the great advantage of being alive 
(instead of undying) is not so much 
that mind no more can disprove than prove 
what heart may feel and soul may touch 
the great (my darling) happens to be 
that love are in we,that love are in we 

and here is a secret they never will share 
for whom create is less than have 
or one times one than when times where 
that we are in love,that we are in love: 
with us they've nothing times nothing to do 
(for love are in we am in i are in you) 

this world(as timorous itsters all 
to call their cowardice quite agree) 
shall never discover our touch and feel 
for love are in we are in love are in we; 
for you are and i am and we are (above 
and under all possible worlds) in love 

a billion brains may coax undeath 
from fancied fact and spaceful time-- 
no heart can leap,no soul can breathe 
but by the sizeless truth of a dream 
whose sleep is the sky and the earth and the sea, 
For love are in you am in i are in we 



============

when faces called flowers float out of the ground 
and breathing is wishing and wishing is having 
but keeping is downward and doubting and never 
it's april(yes,april;my darling) it's spring! 
yes the pretty birds frolic as spry as can fly 
yes the little fish gambol as glad as can be 
(yes the mountains are dancing together) 

when every leaf opens without any sound 
and wishing is having and having is giving 
but keeping is doting and nothing and nonsense 
alive;we're alive,dear:it's(kiss me now)spring! 
now the pretty birds hover so she and so he 
now the little fish quiver so you and so i 
(now the mountains are dancing,the mountains) 

when more than was lost has been found has been found 

and having is giving and giving is living 

but keeping is darkness and winter and cringing 

it's spring (all our night becomes day)o,it's spring! 

all the pretty birds dive to the heart of the sky 

all the little fish climb through the mind of the sea 

(all the mountains are dancing;are dancing) 



============

love our so right 
is,all(each thing 
most lovely) sweet 
things cannot spring 
but we be they'll 

some or if where 
shall breathe a new 
(silverly rare 
goldenly so) 
moon,she is you 

nothing may,quite 
your my (my your 
and) self without, 
completely dare 
be beautiful 



one if should sing 
(at yes of day) 
younger than young 
bird first for joy, 
he's i he's i 


============
now all the fingers of this tree (darling) have 
handstand all the hands have people;and 
more each particular person is (my love) 
alive than every world can understand 

and now you are and i am now and we're 
a mystery which will never happen again, 
a miracle which has never happened before 
and shining this our now must come to then 

our then shall be some darkness during which 
fingers are without hands;and i have no 
you: and all trees are (any more than each 
leafless) its silent in forevering snow 

but never fear(my own,my beautiful 
my blossoming) for also then's until
